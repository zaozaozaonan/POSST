Description: POSST is an open R tool which utilized the spatial information of the sequencing based spatial transcriptomics to analyze and visualize the position-associated biological feature. For a given spatial cluster, niche or area, POSST deliniated the boundary between this area and other region. Besides, the inter-niche and intra-niche spatial distrbution can be evaluated.
