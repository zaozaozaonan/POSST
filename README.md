POSST (position analysis of sequencing-based spatial transcriptomics) is an R package developed to quantify and visualize the intra-niche and inter-niche position, interaction and features spatially. 

POSST can 1) define the boundary between spatial niches to evaluate the distance from each spatial spot to the boundary; 2) evaluate niche-to-niche association, aggregation and co-localization.

POSST are now applicable to multiple sequencing-based spatial transcriptomics platforms including 10x Visium and S1000.
